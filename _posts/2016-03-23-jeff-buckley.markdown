contribution:
- I created an interactive, animated experience for Jeff Buckley's  cover of Bob Dylan's "Just Like a Woman".  The video allows fans to explore the emotional trajectory of a love story.  All built using Canvas, javascript it works on desktop, iphone and android devices.
- Clicking on each of the different panels as the video progresses lets you guide the narrative in one of many programmed directions; a lonely hilltop scene might turn into a colorful romantic picnic.  Elements of the song's instrumentation will also switch up depending on your direction.
